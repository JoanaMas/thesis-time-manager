# Thesis Writing Time Manager's Project by Joana Mastianica

## About The Project

This project was undertaken to apply for the Tietoevry IT Academy's Frontend Developer position. The main objective was to develop a frontend thesis manager application that assists users in optimizing their writing time, staying on track with their progress, and enhancing productivity.

Moreover, this project provided an excellent opportunity to gain proficiency in Typescript, improve project structuring, develop reusable components, and implement them across various sections of the application. It also involved experimenting with components as abstract art figures, leveraging them to create a distinctive design, and exploring other innovative techniques.

## Project Functionalities

* Users can enter information about thesis writing progress & style of work.
* Accordingly, the application displays a time management & productivity dashboard, with some calculations and productivity tips. <br><br>
* Calculations: <br><br>
  * Counts how many hours user should spend on writing thesis daily.
  * Counts work progress in percentages.
  * Counts how many pages left to write.
  * Count how many daily pages you should write, in order to successfully complete your thesis on time.
  * Count how many days are left until the deadline.
  * Picks work schedule depending on selected preference to work either mornings or nights.
  * You can save your dashboard as a PDF file.

<br>

* Other dashboard's UI/UX solutions:
  * Responsive design.
  * Users get different greeting messages depending on selection of morning or evening working style.
  * In case it is a weekend day, and the user selects preference to not work on weekends, the application displays different greetings showing 'Weekend Mode On'. In case you will use application not on a weekend day, you can see what program would display if you would use it on weekends with selection of weekend mode on here:
